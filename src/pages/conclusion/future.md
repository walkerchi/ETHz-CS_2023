## Future

- much much cheaper clean energy
- large-scale automation
- no more chemical rocket
- ...

Note:
Imagine about the future, what if we successfully make the commercial fusion plant come true. 

First, the energy will be much much cheaper then you expected. As the fuel is almost infinity. 

Therefore, large-scale automation could be possible. For example the auto mineral excavation, auto manufacturing, auto garbage recycling and so on.

By the way, if we could fully make use of the fusion power, then the chemical rocket is not necessary anymore.
