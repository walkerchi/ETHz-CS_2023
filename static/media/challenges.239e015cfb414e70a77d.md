## Challenge

- Fuel supply (Deutirium, Tritium, Lithium, Helion-3)
- Neutron
- Plasma Instability (symmetric)
- Manufacturing (material, shape)
- Energy conversion 


Note:
So far, there are still many chanllenges for the magnetic confined fusion.
first one is the fuel. The Deuterium, Tritium, Helion-3 are not so easy to obtain on the earth. But there are plenty of them in the space.
second, the neutron radiation is harmful to the material. And neutron is hard to control as it's not charged. 
thrid, there is high manufacturinig requirement. Especially for the Stellerator.
Forth, the energy coversion from the kinetic energy of particles into the electricity is also a problem.
