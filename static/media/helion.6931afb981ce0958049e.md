Note: 
Another company called the Helion. They drive two field reverse configuration plasma to hit into each other to reach a fusion condition. 
But they use the deuturim and Helion-3 rather than the Tritium. Because there is not neutron in the product. So they could use the Faraday's law to generate electricity from the fast moving charged particles.
