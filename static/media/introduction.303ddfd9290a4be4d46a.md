Note:
So let's begin,
200,000 years ago, we human start to use fire. According to the mass energy equivalence, the fire could turn around $10^{-8}$ percent of mass into energy.

And 2,000 years ago, we start to use fossil fuel like coal, oil and nature gas. They are from dead plants, animals, dinosaurs and even our ancestors. And fossil fuel could turn $10^{-7}$ percent fo mass into energy.

200 years ago, we get to know how to use electricity. But it's currently only a transimission method. We could hardly directly get them from nature.

In less then 100 years, we start to take advantage of the nuclear fission energy. Amazingly, it could turn $0.09$ percent of mass into energy. Today, we have 10% of our total energy from the nuclear fission.

As for the nuclear fusion, it's still not commercialized. Scientits are still doing researchs on them. But I believe it's not far away. The sun have aleardy been there for 5billion years, and there are nuclear fusion in the sun every time!

For the future, maybe we could use the energy from the blackhole, which can turn $33$ percent of mass into energy.
And also the antimatter. It could turn $100$ percent of mass into energy. It's also called annilation.
