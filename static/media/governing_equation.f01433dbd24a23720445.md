## Pinch

$$
-\nabla(p+\frac{B^2}{8\pi})+\frac{1}{4\pi}(B\cdot \nabla)B = 0
$$

$$
B = (0, B_\theta(r),B_z(r))
$$

- $\theta$ pinch
  $$
  B_\theta = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad p(r) = \frac{-B_z^2}{8\pi}+P_0
  $$

- $z$ pinch
  $$
  B_z = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad p(r) = \frac{J_z\pi}{c^2}(a^2-r^2)
  $$
  

unstable

Note:
There is also a very simple method called pinch.
Suppose there is a cylinder. 

If the $\theta$ direction of magnetic field is $0$, which means that the plasma move along the $\theta$ direction. It's $\theta$ pinch. The gradient of $p$ is the force applied to the plasma.

If the $z$ direction of magnetic field is $0$, which means that the plasma move along the $z$ axis. It's $z$ pinch.

But the confinement time for pinch method is too short. And pinch methods also suffer from the unstability problem.
