Note: 
If we do not add a center solenoid coils, we could also twist the toroidal coils to a mobius shape. And this is the Stellerator. 

Because a solenoid coils requires a linear increasing current and the sellerator doesn't need that. So the stellerator doesn't need to be super conducting. And upper bound of the $Q$ of stellerator is infinity! The $Q$ is the net energy divided by the input energy.

However, the Stellerator looks too complex, demanding a high engineering techniques
