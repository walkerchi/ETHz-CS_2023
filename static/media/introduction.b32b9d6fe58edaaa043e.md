Note:
How could we create the fusion environment in engineering. Here are some possible deivces. I don't want to talk about the inertial fusion method today as the confinement time is too small. I'll mainly focus on the magnetic method today.

The first one is the tokamak. The most traditional flavor.

As you can see, the Tokamak is mainly composed of three kinds of coils. 
The Toroidal coils, 
the poloridal coils(verticle coils)
the solenoids coils

So why the tokamak looks like this?

Where, let's think about a Solenoid,
The particles will do the larmor precession inside. 
To more intuitive, it will to the spiral movement.
It seems that the particles could be confined right?
But at both ends of the solenoid, the particles will flee away.

So how to solve this problem, 
Inituitivly, we connect two ends of the solenoids, and the particles seem to be confined inside!

Wait!, there is a magenetic field gradient appears, it's not uniform anymore. An extrac electric field will appear here.

Again, how to solve this? 
Where, for this problem, we could make the magnetic field to form a mobius shape. In this way, the particles will move at outside for half of the time and inside for half of the time.

In the Tokamak, the scientists add a center solenoid coils to rotate the magnetic field in the theta direction.
