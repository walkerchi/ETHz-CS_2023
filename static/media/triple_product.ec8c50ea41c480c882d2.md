**Lawson criterion**ï¼š 

- $T$: Temperature

- $n$ plasma density

- $\tau_E$  confinement time

$$
P\propto Tn\tau_E
$$

Note:
Triple product is defined as the product of temperature, plasma density and confinement time. The temperature and plasma density are easy to understand, but the confinement time is a litter bit confusing. It actually measure how long the container could hold the  hot plasma inside. The better the thermal insulation the longer the reaction could sustain.
